      <description>For some reason I have a weakness for Markdown editors. When I used a MacBook, I started with OmmWriter and later used Byword. I&amp;rsquo;ve been going with Ulysses lately.
Windows has been a more difficult platform to find programs in this area. I have tried various programs from time to time, but have never been able to find a properly working program with the features I want.
Caret has been a gem for me that I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to find for years.</description>
